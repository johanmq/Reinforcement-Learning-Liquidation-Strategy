In this project we review the paper of Bao and Liu (2019), Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Liquidation Strategy Analysis.

We first propose a complete summary of the techniques used in the original paper as well as the main results. Then, we detail a few critics and developments we made on the original algorithm: new agent behavior and non-linear price impact.

The study was conducted by Johan Macq, Antoine Lefebvre, Benoit Ane and Jeremy Marck during ENSAE Master 2 year.

The code is available on request. The original paper is available here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.11046.pdf
